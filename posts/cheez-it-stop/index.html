  <h2>Cheez-It Stop: A Cheddar Cracker Oasis</h2>
  <h3>June 7, 2023</h3>

  

<p>A Cheez-It pop-up stand has taken over a gas station in Joshua Tree. For one week (June 5th-June 11th), the desert is becoming a cheddar cracker oasis. This must be the summer road trip that the Cheez-It social media accounts have been hyping up the past few weeks. Appropriately named Cheez-It Stop, this is a must see stop for any cheddar cracker enthusiast.</p>
<p>At the entrance is a sign showing off the snack&rsquo;s new slogan, &ldquo;Want it. Need it. Cheez-It.&rdquo;. Cacti surrounding the sign have been topped with Cheez-It crackers. There must be a protective coating on those crackers to withstand the wind that is common around the area. A guest&rsquo;s hat flew off her head while I was there but the crackers remained still.</p>

<p>Yellow diamonds cover the edges of the sidewalk. On closer inspection each diamond is actually a painting of a Cheez-It cracker. These paintings are scattered throughout the walls and fixtures of the rest stop.</p>

<p>Visitors are immediately greeted with a map and a series of Cheez-it themed benches to enjoy a snack. I should have checked the napkins at the tables to see if there was anything printed on them. The napkin holders were designed to look like Cheez-It crackers.</p>

<p>Immediately to the right of the entrance is an information desk handing out brown paper bags with Cheez-It themed stickers plastered on them. The bags are to be used on the highlight of the experience, the Cheez-It Pump. Beyond the information desk is a van that doubles as a photo booth. For the sake of the privacy of people waiting in line, I did not take any pictures of the photo booth.</p>
<p>Wait times were not an issue at Cheez-It Stop. There was a steady flow of guests. Perhaps Cheez-It Stop was a bigger success than the PR team was expecting. Although the shop containing Cheez-It merchandise looked full, it was apparent that most of the inventory had been wiped out. A sheet of paper near the cash register had a list of items with 10 items marked as sold out. On the bright side, most of the merchandise is available online, but it would have been nice to pick up a key chain, bandanna and shot glass.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the exclusive Cheez-It Stop shirt was still in stock. It features a pack of wolves howling at a giant Cheez-It cracker instead of the moon. With word spreading about Cheez-It Stop and people driving in from Texas and Arizona, I hope that there is a new shipment of merch to get through the weekend. Rumor has it that hard to find Cheez-It flavors were also supposed to be available for purchase, but all I found were standard boxes.</p>

<p>Walking out of the store and facing Twentynine Palms Highway you can see Big Josh, a twenty-foot-tall statue that is a fixture of the gas station, holding a gas pump that has been painted red. The Cheez-It logo is prominently displayed on the center of it. Prop cars are at the gas pumps. A van at the corner of the gas station is parked next to the best part about Cheez-It Stop, the Cheez-It Pump.</p>

<p>The Cheez-It Pump is exactly what it sounds like. It&rsquo;s a giant pump that dispenses bags of Cheez-It crackers. This is where those paper bags that the information desk comes into play. The pump attendant will catch the bags that shoot out and even toss in a few extra bags. Depending on how many people you drive up to Cheez-It Stop with you may be leaving with a box worth of crackers for free.</p>

<p>Actually, aside from the merchandise available for sale, the experience was free. No charge for the photo booth. Free parking. No fee to enter. Cheez-It Stop is a great time and worth checking out if you can make the drive out there. It is open from 10 AM - 6 PM until Sunday, June 11th. Set your GPS destination with this address, 61943 Twentynine Palms Highway, Joshua Tree, CA 92252.</p>
